- [sum, mul, sub for long arithmetic on assembler](https://github.com/GoPavel/cpp-course/tree/master/assembler)
- [big_integer](https://github.com/GoPavel/cpp-course/tree/master/big_integer) - long arithmetic on C++.
- [big_integer_optimization](https://github.com/GoPavel/cpp-course/tree/master/big_integer_optimization) - previous project with small-object and copy-on-write optimization.
- [huffman](https://github.com/GoPavel/cpp-course/tree/master/huffman) - Implement compression algorithm in C++. And
organize code in library.
- [list_debug](https://github.com/GoPavel/cpp-course/tree/master/list_debug) - Implement debug version linked list in C++.
Itâ€™s same std::list with a lot of test, when std::list
has undefined behavior.
- [persistent_set](https://github.com/GoPavel/cpp-course/tree/master/persistent_set) - persistent_set in C++, which base on own [smart pointers](https://github.com/GoPavel/cpp-course/tree/master/persistent_set/smart_pointers)
- [testing](https://github.com/GoPavel/cpp-course/tree/master/testing) - my collection of examples about C++ features.
